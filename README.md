A cutting-edge financial analysis platform that leverages **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** neural networks to predict stock price movements with unprecedented accuracy. This project combines a stateless **FastAPI** backend (`app.py`) that serves historical market data, linear/LSTM forecasts, and VADER sentiment scores with a modern **Flutter web client** (`flutter_app/`) featuring an elegant glass morphism UI, interactive charts, and comprehensive technical indicators.

The Flutter frontend can be deployed to Vercel as a static site, while the backend can be hosted on Render or any Python-compatible platform.

## Backend (FastAPI)

### Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - Includes FastAPI, Uvicorn, Pandas, NumPy, yfinance, joblib, TensorFlow (for
    optional LSTM inference), and VADER sentiment.
  - On Apple Silicon, install `tensorflow-macos` + `tensorflow-metal` for GPU acceleration.

### Running locally

```bash
cd "/Users/shaunak/Projects/Stock Prediction"
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app:app --reload --port 8000
```

Key endpoints:

| Method | Path         | Description                                                |
|--------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/health`    | Lightweight health probe.                                 |
| GET    | `/overview`  | Historical OHLCV data + summary metrics + price history.  |
| GET    | `/forecast`  | Linear or LSTM forecast (if a saved model exists).        |
| GET    | `/sentiment` | Latest Yahoo Finance headlines scored with VADER.         |
| GET    | `/models`    | Lists available saved LSTM model + scaler pairs.          |

Environment variables:

- `HOST` / `PORT` (optional) when launching via `python app.py` or Uvicorn.
- Model artifacts live in `models/` and are auto-discovered (`*.keras` + scaler `.pkl`).

### Tests

Run the existing pytest suite (validates the linear forecast helper):

```bash
pytest
```

### Deploy to Render (production)

The repo ships with a `render.yaml` and `Procfile` so you can deploy the FastAPI
backend to [Render](https://render.com/) with a couple of clicks:

1. Commit and push your changes to GitHub.
2. Log in to Render, choose **New ‚Üí Web Service**, and select your repository.
3. Render auto-detects the `render.yaml` manifest‚Äîaccept the defaults (Python
  runtime, `uvicorn` start command, `/health` check).
4. Click **Create Web Service**; Render will build the service using
  `pip install -r requirements.txt` and launch `uvicorn app:app` on the
  allocated `$PORT`.
5. Once the service status is **Live**, grab the public URL (e.g.
  `https://stock-backend.onrender.com`) and set it as the
  `API_BASE_URL` for the Flutter web build.

Future pushes to the `main` branch will auto-deploy as long as
`autoDeploy: true` remains in `render.yaml`.

## Flutter Web Client

The Flutter front-end provides a premium user experience with a Material 3 glass morphism design, featuring interactive charts (via `fl_chart`), animated hero headers, comprehensive technical indicators (SMA/EMA), and real-time sentiment analysis. The UI adapts dynamically to different screen sizes and includes helpful tooltips and loading states. The app is optimized for Flutter web builds and can be deployed to Vercel as a static site.

### Key UI Components

- **Hero Header**: Large gradient title with animated icon, comprehensive project description, and positioned help button
- **Glass Containers**: Frosted glass effect with backdrop blur and gradient borders
- **Interactive Charts**: 
  - Historical price chart with 120-day lookback
  - Forecast chart with separate historical and predicted lines
  - Technical indicator overlays (SMA-20/50, EMA-12/26)
  - Smart tooltips with date and price information
- **Metric Cards**: Animated cards displaying latest close, volume, range, and volatility
- **Loading States**: Shimmer effects and rolling messages during data fetches
- **Dynamic Theming**: Ticker-based accent colors for visual variety

### Project structure

```
flutter_app/
  pubspec.yaml            # Flutter + package dependencies (fl_chart 0.66.2)
  analysis_options.yaml   # Lints
  lib/
    api_client.dart       # REST wrapper around FastAPI endpoints
    models.dart           # JSON data classes for API responses
    main.dart             # Dashboard UI + charts + animations
  build/
    web/                  # Compiled output for deployment
```

### Local development

Make sure Flutter 3.3+ is installed (with web support enabled):

```bash
cd flutter_app
flutter pub get

# Run with local backend
flutter run -d chrome --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Or serve the built version locally
flutter build web --no-tree-shake-icons
cd build/web
python3 -m http.server 3000
```

**Note**: Use `--no-tree-shake-icons` flag to avoid icon tree shaking issues during build.

The `API_BASE_URL` `dart-define` points the web client at your local FastAPI server (default: `http://localhost:8000`).

### Build for Vercel

```bash
cd flutter_app
flutter build web --release --no-tree-shake-icons --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend.example.com
```

The compiled output will be in `flutter_app/build/web`. Deploy this directory to Vercel as a static site:

1. **Push to GitHub**: Commit and push the built files to your repository
2. **Connect to Vercel**: Import your repository in the Vercel dashboard
3. **Configure Build Settings**:
   - Build Command: `cd flutter_app && flutter build web --release --no-tree-shake-icons`
   - Output Directory: `flutter_app/build/web`
   - Install Command: (leave default or use custom Flutter installation)
4. **Set Environment Variables**: Add `API_BASE_URL` as a Vercel environment variable pointing to your hosted FastAPI backend
5. **Deploy**: Vercel will automatically build and deploy on every push to main

The project includes a `vercel.json` configuration for proper routing of Flutter web apps.

## Training LSTM models (optional)

The project includes pre-trained LSTM models for AAPL, META, NVDA, and TSLA. To train additional models:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python train_lstm.py TSLA --epochs 50 --batch-size 32
```

This generates:
- `models/lstm_TSLA.keras` ‚Äî Trained LSTM model
- `models/scaler_TSLA.save` ‚Äî Min-max scaler for normalization

Any ticker with a matching model+scaler pair automatically appears in the `/models` endpoint and enables LSTM forecasts in the Flutter app.
